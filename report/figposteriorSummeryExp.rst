To clarify the results summery plots, this figure illustrates the posterior distribution of the effect size by the example transition 14 to 10 (primed promoter to promoter).
The horizontal line marks the most likely log(Odds-Ratio) for the given transition (14 to 10).
In the summery plot this is the value for the abscissa.
The gray area is the portion of the posterior which crosses zero.
(This is calculated not by the posterior samples, but a normal fit of those samples.)
In the summery plot this is the value for the ordinate.
