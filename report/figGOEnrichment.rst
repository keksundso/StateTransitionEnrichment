To evaluate meaningful transitions (see below) the genes who perform them are extracted from the Gene list of interested.
To facilitate the evaluation, a GO-Enrichment analysis of those genes where performed.
The file GOEnrichment.pdf_ is the collection of those analysis for which a "significant" (p<0.05) Enrichment has been found.

List of Meaningful transitions: "9.9", "13.15", "8.4", "8.15", "11.9", "15.3", "6.7", "6.9", "8.9", "11.15", "3.15", "7.9", "3.3", "7.6", "15.15"
