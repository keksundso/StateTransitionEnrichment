To summarize the posterior model, the most likely log odds ratio are plotted against the probability that for the given transition the log odds ratio is actually zero or opposite from what would be suspected based on the most likely value (does this need an explanatory figure??).
This way for each transition it can be easily accessed, how enriched or depleted it is in the gene set of interested (Effect size) and how much this assessment can be trusted.

--- Plausibility
******************************

To evaluate the plausibility of the obtained results, the analysis was first performed on a set of house keeping genes (265) HKGList_BinomialModle_summeryPlot.pdf_ obtained from 'Jonge et al <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000898>'_ .
Of the 225 transition the top three show a persistence of an active state (TSS expressed gene, active promoter and expressed gene) in both cell types.
Similarly, of the top 13 all but one transition (empty to TSS expressed gene) are from one active state to an active state.
This clear enrichment of active states in proliferating as well as hypertrophic chondrocytes, demonstrates the plausibility of the obtained inferences.

--- Three GO-Terms
******************************

For the analysis itself the genes of interested are 334 which are associated to either (chondrocyte differentiation, limb development or cartilage development) (threeGOList_BinomialModle_summeryPlot.pdf_).
For this set only the transition from an empty to an empty state seems to be meanifully depleted.
On the other side, several transitions seem to have either a high effect size, high confidene or both. We will focus here on those with the clearest separation from the majority which are (6.9, 6.7, 8.9, 15.3, 11.9, 8.15, 8.4, 13.15, 11.15, 15.15, 7.6, 7.9, 3.3 and 3.15).
