Shown is the posterior predictive check for the binomial model.
The transitions are ranked according to their occurrences in the background gene set along the abscissa.
Each data point represents how often a given transition occurs in the gene set (Either genes of Interest (blue) or Genes of the Background (black)).
The gray bares represent the 11%-89% density intervals of the posterior predictions of the model, with the horizontal line marking the most likely prediction.

It can be seen that each data point is very close to the most likely prediction, and always within the 11%-89% densities.
Showing that the data is very well represented by the binomial model.
